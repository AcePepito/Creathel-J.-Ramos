            <p>Hi, I am Creathel J. Ramos. A first year student of Bachelor of Science in Forestry, studying at Caraga State University - Main Campus. This is my first time creating a website and I'm really having fun playing around with the codes.</p>

            <h2># My Motto in Life</h2>
            </br>
            <h3>"Start where you are,</br> Use what you have,</br> Do what you can."</h3>
            <p> I chose this quote as my motto in life, because it gives so much motivation. 'Cause no matter where you start in life, no matter what situation you are facing in your life, there is always the potential to achieve success. As long as you choose to start and use whatever resources you can utilize. There will never be no hindrance to success. </p>

            <h2># My Hobby</h2>
            </br>
            <h3>Creative Writing</h3>
            <p>Just as how I love reading stories, I also have the passion in creative writing. Writing helps me express my emotion, it helps me become more creative and imaginative. Writing is also one of my escape to reality.</p>
